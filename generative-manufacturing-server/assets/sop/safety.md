# Prusa Printer Safety Protocols

## Emergency Stop (Reset)
- **Immediate Action:** Locate the **Reset Button** (marked with an 'X') directly next to the control knob on the LCD panel.
- **Press Firmly:** Pressing this immediately resets the printer, cutting power to the motors and heaters.

## Power Panic & Thermal Runaway
- **Power Switch:** If the screen is unresponsive or displays "Thermal Runaway", turn off the master power switch located on the Power Supply Unit (PSU) at the back right of the printer.
- **Unplug:** For absolute safety during an electrical fault, disconnect the power cable from the wall outlet.

## Hot Components
- **Nozzle & Bed:** Do not touch the nozzle (up to 300°C) or heatbed (up to 120°C) during operation or cool-down.
- **Pinch Points:** Keep hands clear of the X, Y, and Z axis movements.
