# Layer Shift SOP

## Diagnosis
Layers are displaced horizontally, creating a stepped or leaning effect.

## Immediate Actions
1. **PAUSE** the printer if the shift is minor and potentially salvageable (rare).
2. **STOP** if the part is compromised.

## TROUBLESHOOTING
* Check belt tension (X and Y axis).
* Check for collisions or obstructions.
* Verify motor current/temperature.
